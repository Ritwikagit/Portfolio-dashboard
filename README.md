# Portfolio Dashboard

Personal Portfolio
Welcome to my Personal Portfolio project! This is a sleek, responsive portfolio website I built using **React**, **Vite**, and **TailwindCSS**. It showcases my web development skills through a clean design, smooth animations, and interactive UI components.

## Features

- **Performance focused**: Built with Vite for fast development and optimized builds, styled with TailwindCSS utility classes.
- **Interactive UI**: Includes animated sections and a mobile-friendly hamburger menu with smooth open/close transitions.
- **Fully responsive**: Looks great on desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
- **Modern and clean design**: Inspired by SaaS websites, featuring a glass-effect navbar and smooth animations to enhance user experience.

## Technologies

- **React:** To build reusable, component-based UI.
- **Vite:** A fast, modern build tool that speeds up development.
- **TailwindCSS:** Utility-first CSS for quick and consistent styling.
- **JavaScript (ES6+):** Leveraging modern JavaScript features and best practices.
